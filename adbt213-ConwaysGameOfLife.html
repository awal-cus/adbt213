      <h3>Aaron Walsh</h3>
      <p> 
        I'm a relatively new, self-taught programmer, all the knowledge I've amassed to this point has come through my professional experience working with web based companies and working in a business development capacity for my friend's cyber-security company. And I'm looking to formally fill the gaps in my knowledge so I can go on and be an entrepreneur in some capacity, both to solve real world issues, and satisfy the creative type in me.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Conway's Game of Life</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). 
  This project demonstrates an understanding of 2D Arrays and of using methods to manipulate an appealing visual output.


  This project is my version of Conway's game of life. The 'Game' is a simple set of rules: 

  'Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.

  Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.

  All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.'

  It is what's known as a zero-player game, who's outcome is solely dependant on the initial grid state, and takes no further input. In the time limit set I managed to set it up with a new random grid layout every time the script is run, but in future I will adapt it to take user input initially, and some time counter which can count how long it takes for the 'civilisation' to die out, or reach a point of stability.
